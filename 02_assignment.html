        Q. How do the elements appear? Does the width have any effect? Why / Why not?
        Ans. The elements are side by side in the same line. Width doesnt have any effect on them because 

        Q. Next, set display to inline. Does it cause any change? Why / Why not?
        Ans. No visible changes are seen. Because these span element are already inline, so it remains same.


        Q. Next, change display to block. What change does it cause?
        Ans. The elements now appear each in the next line. Because now each span elements are taking up the whole width of the screen, thus appearing now in the next line.

        Q. Next, set display to inline-block. What change does it cause?
        Ans. The first two elements appear in the same line but not side by side, there is almost 40% width in between the two. The third element is in the next line as it couldn't fit in the same line as the width occupied by one element is 40% of the total width.

        Q. In conclusion, summarize the differences you noticed in the 3 behavior of the 3 display 
           types. Search for other differences and jot them down mentally / physically! :)
        Ans.
